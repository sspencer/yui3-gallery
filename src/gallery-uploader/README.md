# BrowserPlus Uploader

Uploader is a YUI3 Widget that uses [BrowserPlus](http://browserplus.org/) to create an advanced
file uploader widget. The Uploader widget supports native drag+drop from the desktop, multiple
file selection, simultaneous uploads (3 files at a time), image resizing, archiving (tar, zip) and
compression (bzip2, gzip, zip). Files may be filtered by size and mime type (for example, only
image files may be selected).
