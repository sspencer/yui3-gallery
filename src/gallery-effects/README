Version 0.5
-----------

This is the first official version and includes basic support for all of the core
Scriptaculous effects as well as some of the more complex ones.  I plan on releasing
this as version 1.0 once all of the Scriptaculous effects have been ported over and
the documentation is complete.  Stay tuned!
